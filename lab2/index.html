			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a webpage with a header of Hello World and a paragraph about me and my partner. We then needed to use CSS to style the page as well.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I have experience with HTML and CSS but I had forgot a few of the smaller niche parts of it which my partner David helped remind me about. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a fun lab that allowed us to explore and experiment with the coding languages at our disposal to create our own webpages. We worked on our pages during section and in our free time!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<a href="./lab2/index.html">Results</a>
					<p> We made webpages worthy of the GOATS.</p>

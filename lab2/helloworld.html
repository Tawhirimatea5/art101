					<h2>About Vincent and David</h2>
					<p>My name is Vincent I am a third year and Agpm major just like my partner David who has been incredible. I am from Los Angeles and New Zealand and have experience in both coding and art envirometns. Me and David have had some very fun conversations over discord using gifs to discuss if Messi or Ronaldo is the better footballer. Personally I believe I showed him that it is Lionel Messi but he was supporting Ronaldo so we will see if I have swayed him. We also both enjoy playing football, the gym, and video games.
